<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view in the orientation material for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your project.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this project. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the project. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>



<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
<p>If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Source Code</h2>

<p>You will find a driver source code file named <strong>Proj02.py</strong> 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Python Version Requirements</h2>
<p>Python is somewhat version sensitive, particularly between version 2.x and 
version 3.x. Your project will be graded using Python version 3.6.2 or a later version.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Specific Project Requirements</h2>
<p>Specific project requirements follow:</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="10">

    <tr>
      <td><p>Proj02 Copyright 2022 R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, this project requires you to 
demonstrate a basic knowledge of frequency 
distributions and histograms. In this project you will write Python code to create 
the data for a frequency
distribution chart that emulates a histogram for a
given dataset. You will write that code without importing any libraries. </p>
	  <p>Before going any further, you should make certain that you have read 
	  the prescribed material in the Ebook. You can identify that material by 
	  selecting <strong>Asg02</strong> in the Bb menu and then selecting <strong>
	  MLO-1.2 Objectives, Read, and Do</strong>. If you don't understand 
	  something in that material, you should ask your instructor for 
	  clarification.<em>
	  </em>
	  </p>

	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Write and submit a Python module named <strong>Proj02Runner.py</strong> that works in 
		conjunction with the driver source code contained 
		in the file named <strong>Proj02.py</strong> to produce the output 
		illustrated by <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#Figure_2">
		Figure 2</a>, and <a href="#Figure_3">Figure 3</a> below on the command-line screen.</p>
	  <p>Be sure that your name appears in the certification as indicated.</p>
	  <p>The code that you&nbsp;write must not import anything.</p>
	  <p>The program must terminate and return control to the operating system 
	  when control reaches the end of the file named <strong>Proj02.py</strong>. 
	  In other words, infinite loops are not allowed.</p>
	  <p>Do not copy the code from the file named <strong>Proj02.py</strong> into your file named 
	  <strong>Proj02Runner.py</strong>.</p>
		<p>You must not modify the code in the file named <strong>Proj02.py</strong>. Your instructor will execute the 
		code in his original version of the file named <strong>Proj02.py</strong> in the same 
		folder as your file named <strong>Proj02Runner.py</strong> for the purpose of grading your assignment. 
		If you modify the code in your copy of the file named <strong>Proj02.py</strong>, it is unlikely that 
		your program will run successfully when tested.</p>
	  <p>The required output depends on three command-line arguments that are 
	  entered when the 
	  program is run. The command-line arguments are used to create a dataset. Three sample outputs with different command-line arguments are shown below. 
	  You can use those sample outputs to test 
	  your program. </p>
	  <p>Your instructor will use a different set of command-line arguments 
	  than any of the three shown below to create a dataset and grade your program. Your code must be 
	  able accommodate a different dataset regardless of the number and/or 
	  range of values in the dataset. </p>
	  <p>You should begin by analyzing the code in the file named <strong>
	  Proj02.py</strong>. In particular, analyze the construction of the dataset 
	  in the list 
	  named <strong>data</strong> to get an idea of what you will be working 
	  with. That list, which is shown at the top of each sample below, will be passed to your function named <strong>run</strong> 
	  in a class named <strong>Runner</strong> in a file named <strong>
	  Proj02Runner.py</strong>. Before writing any code, you should try to 
	  replicate the charts shown below with pencil and paper using the dataset shown at 
	  the top of each sample. Once you can do that, you should be able to 
	  convert that process into code.</p>
	  <p>Your challenge is to process that incoming dataset in such a way as to 
	  return a list which, when processed by the code in the file named <strong>
	  Proj02.py</strong>, will create a frequency distribution chart that 
	  emulates a histogram.</p>
