<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view in the orientation material for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your project.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this project. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the project. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>



<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
<p>If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Source Code</h2>

<p>You will find a driver source code file named <strong>Proj03.py</strong> 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Python Version Requirements</h2>
<p>Python is somewhat version sensitive, particularly between version 2.x and 
version 3.x. Your project will be graded using Python version 3.6.2 or a later version.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Specific Project Requirements</h2>
<p>Specific project requirements follow:</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="10">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Proj03 Copyright 2017 R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, this project requires that you write a program that 
demonstrates your knowledge of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Relationships between variables as illustrated using a scatter plot</li>

	<li>Best-fit line on a scatter plot</li>
	<li>Standard normal probability density function</li>
	<li>Range from minus three sigma to plus three sigma</li>
	<li>Relative frequency histogram</li>
	<li>Positively and negatively skewed distributions</li>
	<li>Cumulative distribution function of the standard normal probability density function</li>




</ul>
	  <p>Before going any further, you should make certain that you have read the 
	  prescribed material in the Ebook. You can identify that material by 
	  selecting <strong>Asg03</strong> in the Bb menu and then selecting <strong>
	  MLO-1.3 Objectives, Read, and Do</strong>. If you don't understand 
	  something in that material, you should ask your instructor for 
	  clarification.</p>
	  <p>Also see the lesson titled <em>Histogram Plotting Preview</em> in the 
	  Ebook.</p>
<h2>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
		<p>Write and submit a Python module named <strong>Proj03Runner.py</strong> that works in 
		conjunction with the driver source code contained 
		in the file named <strong>Proj03.py</strong> to produce the output 
		illustrated by <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#Figure_2">
		Figure 2</a> below.</p>
	  <p>Be sure that your name appears in the certification as indicated and 
	  also at 
	  the top of the output image as indicated.</p>
	  <p>The program must terminate and return control to the operating system 
	  when the user dismisses the image by clicking the X-button on the image 
	  window.</p>
	  <p>Do not copy the code from the file named <strong>Proj03.py</strong> into your file named 
	  <strong>Proj03Runner.py</strong>.</p>
		<p>You may not modify the code in the file named <strong>Proj03.py</strong>. Your instructor will execute the 
		code in his original version of the file named <strong>Proj03.py</strong> in the same 
		folder as your file named <strong>Proj03Runner.py</strong> for the purpose of grading your assignment. 
		If you modify the code in your file named <strong>Proj03.py</strong>, it is unlikely that 
		your program will run successfully when tested.</p>
	  <h3>Specifications for the output image</h3>
	  <p>The output image must be a single image containing an independent 
	  display in each of four quadrants as shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
	  <p><strong>Scatter plot</strong></p>
	  <p>The upper-left quadrant must display a noisy relationship between two 
	  random variables exhibiting a positive correlation similar to that shown 
	  in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. Create and plot approximately 100 data pairs and draw the 
	  best fit line as shown.</p>
	  <p><strong>Standard normal probability density function</strong></p>
	  <p>Plot the standard normal probability density function from minus three sigma to plus three sigma in the 
	  upper-right quadrant as shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.This 
	  must be an exact copy of (not just similar to) that shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
	  <p><strong>Histogram for positively skewed data</strong></p>
	  <p>The lower-left quadrant must display a relative frequency histogram for 
	  data with a positively skewed distribution similar to that shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. 
	  Use a random number generator to create the data being plotted in the 
	  histogram. Cause the data values to range from zero to 2000 and cause your 
	  histogram to have 50 bins. Generate enough data to ensure that the 
	  histogram is relatively smooth with no gaps indicating empty bins.</p>
	  <p><strong>Cumulative distribution function of the standard normal 
	  probability density function</strong></p>
	  <p>Plot the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal 
	  probability density function from minus three sigma to plus three sigma in the 
	  lower-right quadrant as shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. This 
	  must be an exact copy of (not just similar to) that shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
	  <p><strong>Template files</strong></p>
	  <p>To help you get started, the zip file from which you downloaded this 
	  file also contains two files named <strong>Proj.py</strong> and <strong>ProjRunner.py</strong>. 
	  Executing the file named <strong>Proj.py</strong> should produce the 
	  output shown in <a href="#Figure_3">Figure 3</a>. You can use 
	  the file named <strong>ProjRunner.py</strong> as a template 
	  for your file named <strong>Proj03Runner.py</strong>.</p>
	  <h3>Specifications for output on command-line screen</h3>
	  <p>The command-line screen output from your program must display the 
	  certification shown in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>.</p>
	  <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <strong>normed</strong> parameter has been removed 
	  from the <strong>hist</strong> method in later versions of pyplot. <strong>
	  Don't use "normed=True". Use "density=True" instead.</strong></p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: On this and future assignments, your system/code may or may 
not put interactive controls on the bottom of the output image as shown in
<a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. That doesn't matter. Interactive controls are 
not a requirement of the assignments.</p>
